Great question! If you're showcasing your app on your portfolio website and you want employers to test it while keeping your Firebase API keys and credentials secure, 

here’s the best approach:

Best Practices for a Public Demo

1. Use Firebase's Client-Side Authentication for Public Users
- Firebase provides a public API key that can be used in the frontend.
- This is different from the Admin SDK (which should be kept secret).
- You can safely expose this public API key without security risks.

2. Create a Separate "Demo" Firebase Project
- If you’re worried about abuse, create a separate Firebase project just for your demo.
- Limit permissions (e.g., read-only access or temporary login credentials).

3. Host the Demo on a Separate URL
- Example: https://gitbridge-demo.web.app/
- Your portfolio can link to this demo instead of exposing sensitive credentials.

How to Set Up Firebase for a Public Demo

Modify your frontend firebaseConfig.js to use Firebase's client SDK:

// firebaseConfig.js (Frontend version for public demo)
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyDfN5B_nFIrQvDzeXRE_8nvd6zm8Uyp4aI", // Safe to expose (only for public Firebase services)
  authDomain: "gitbridge-app.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "gitbridge-app",
  storageBucket: "gitbridge-app.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "341376284308",
  appId: "1:341376284308:web:73d40d37c73ede83f52681"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Export Firebase services
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
export const storage = getStorage(app);

Important Notes:
- This file is safe for your frontend because it only allows authentication, database access, and storage.
- Employers can sign up and test your app without you exposing sensitive admin credentials.

How Employers Can Test Your App

Step 1: On your portfolio site, add a button:

<a href="https://gitbridge-demo.web.app/" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>

Step 2: Employers can log in using Google, GitHub, or email/password (as set in Firebase Authentication).

Step 3: They can create a Git repo, test commits, and see how your UI works.

How to Keep the Backend API Secure:
- Do NOT expose the Firebase Admin SDK in the frontend
- Use Firebase Security Rules to restrict database access
- Limit public access in Firebase settings (e.g., read-only for demo users)

Alternative Approach:
If your app needs full access (e.g., admin actions like deleting data, managing users):
- Create a temporary test account (e.g., testuser@demo.com with password Test1234!).
- Provide this login on your portfolio so employers can use it.
- Add a "Reset Demo Data" button that clears test data periodically.

Final Thoughts:
You can showcase your app while keeping sensitive data hidden by:
- Using frontend Firebase SDK (safe API key)
- Creating a separate Firebase project for demos.
- Adding temporary test accounts for employers.
- Hosting a live demo on GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, or Vercel.
