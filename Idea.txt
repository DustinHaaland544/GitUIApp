That’s a great point! In fact, many code editors already have some level of Git integration, though not always as seamless as you might want. Here’s a breakdown:

1. VS Code (Microsoft’s Own Editor)
VS Code actually does have built-in Git integration with buttons for Add, Commit, Push, Pull, Merge, etc. It’s not as feature-rich as a dedicated Git GUI like 
GitKraken or SourceTree, but you don’t need the terminal for basic Git tasks.

- You can stage changes, commit, and push using the Source Control panel.
- Extensions like GitHub Copilot and GitLens enhance Git capabilities.
- If you install the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension, you can even create/manage PRs within VS Code.

2. Atom (No Longer Maintained)
Git and GitHub integration were included in Atom (developed by GitHub before Microsoft acquired it), but Atom was officially discontinued in 2022.

3. Sublime Text & Notepad++
These editors are lighter and faster but don’t have built-in Git support. You can, however:

- Install Sublime Merge (by SublimeHQ) for Git integration.
- Use plugins like GitGutter for Sublime Text.
- Notepad++ isn’t designed for Git workflows but can use Git plugins.

4. Why Doesn’t Microsoft Create a Full Git UI in All Editors?
- Microsoft already owns VS Code, which has Git support, so they likely see no need to add Git to Notepad++ or Sublime, which aren't their products.
- Dedicated Git clients exist (GitKraken, SourceTree, GitHub Desktop), and many developers prefer them over embedding Git directly into lightweight editors.
- Power users prefer terminals: Many devs still prefer using Git commands in a terminal for more control.

What’s the Ideal Solution?
Microsoft could create a universal Git UI across all editors, but they already push VS Code as the go-to editor. If you want a fully GUI-based Git workflow, GitHub 
Desktop or GitKraken are your best bets.

That would be a game-changer! Imagine a universal Git UI that works seamlessly across VS Code, Sublime, Notepad++, JetBrains IDEs, Eclipse, and even lightweight editors. 
No more remembering commands—just buttons like "Stage," "Commit," "Push," "Branch," "Merge" across every coding environment.

How It Could Work:

1. Universal Git Plugin/API
- Microsoft (or GitHub) could develop a standardized Git UI API that editors can integrate.
- Would work as a lightweight extension or built-in feature.

2. Cross-Editor Git Dashboard
- A floating, detachable Git UI that works the same way in every editor.
- Supports drag-and-drop staging, visual branching, and interactive rebase.

3. Offline & Cloud Sync
- Can push/pull from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
- Allows tracking changes across devices (like Google Docs for code).

4. AI-Assisted Git (Copilot Integration?)
- Auto-generate commit messages.
- Suggest best merge conflict resolutions.

That sounds like an ambitious and exciting project! If you decide to build it, I can definitely help you with coding, architecture, and integrating Git functionalities 
into different editors.

Here’s a high-level roadmap for your Git UI:

1. Core Features:
- Universal Git UI with buttons for Add, Commit, Push, Pull, Merge, Branching
- Drag-and-drop staging area
- Interactive rebase & conflict resolution
- Multi-editor compatibility (VS Code, Sublime, Notepad++, JetBrains, etc.)
- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket integration

2. Tech Stack Suggestions:
- Frontend: React (Electron for desktop UI) or Tauri (Rust-based alternative)
- Backend: Node.js (for Git commands) or Rust (for performance)
- Git Integration: Use isomorphic-git (for JavaScript) or call libgit2 for native support
- Editor Plugins: Develop API extensions for VS Code, JetBrains, Sublime, Notepad++, etc.

3. Strategy to Sell It
- Build a solid MVP – Release a free version with essential features.
- Get user feedback – Early adopters will help refine it.
- Monetize – Offer a premium version or SaaS model.
- Pitch to Big Tech – If Microsoft or Facebook sees value, they might acquire it.
