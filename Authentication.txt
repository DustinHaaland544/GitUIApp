To implement this authentication system in your Git UI app, you can follow these steps:

1. Integrate OAuth Authentication:
- Use OAuth to authenticate users with their Git accounts (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). This will give your app the necessary access to verify the user's 
identity and their repositories.
- Use libraries like Firebase Authentication or Passport.js to manage OAuth flow and securely authenticate users. Firebase Authentication can simplify this process 
by handling the entire flow for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket logins.

2. Store User Authentication Info:
- Once the user logs in via OAuth, save their authentication tokens (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) in your app's state or a session. This will allow you to check if 
they are logged in and which account they are logged into.

3. Verify the Repo Link:
- When a user pastes a repo link, extract the username or organization part of the URL (e.g., in GitHub, it's in the github.com/username/repo-name format).
- Compare the username in the link with the authenticated user’s Git account. If they match, proceed to connect the repo to the user's account without requiring 
re-authentication.

4. Prompt Authentication When Needed:
- If the username in the repo link does not match the authenticated user’s account or if the user is not logged in, prompt the user to log in again with their Git 
account to verify ownership before proceeding with the connection.

5. Security Measures:
- Use secure tokens (OAuth tokens) to ensure that each API request is authorized.
- Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for extra security when users log in or connect a repo to their account.
- Ensure that repo connections are limited to the user's repositories by checking if the authenticated user has access to the requested repository.

6. Flow Implementation Example:
- Step 1: User logs in via OAuth (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
- Step 2: User pastes the repo link.
- Step 3: Extract username from the link and compare it with the authenticated username.
  -> If matched: Connect the repo directly.
  -> If not matched or user not authenticated: Prompt user for login and verify repo ownership.

Firebase Authentication provides an easy-to-integrate and secure method for handling user authentication. To proceed, we'll need to:

1. Set Up Firebase Authentication:
- Enable sign-in methods for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket in your Firebase console.
- Integrate Firebase Auth SDK in your front-end project.

2. Implement Authentication Flow:
- Implement the login process where users can authenticate via their GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account.
- Use the authentication data to verify if the repo link belongs to the authenticated user.

3. Ensure Repo Ownership Verification:
- Once logged in, if the user pastes a Git repo link, check if the link matches the logged-in account's username.
- If the repo belongs to the user, directly connect the repo; otherwise, ask the user to log in.

Let's start by setting up Firebase Authentication for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket sign-ins in Firebase.

Step 1: Set up Authentication in Firebase Console:

1. Go to Firebase Console:
- Navigate to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com [nasifshah548@gmail.com])
- Select your project (or create a new one if needed).

2. Enable Authentication Providers:
- In the Firebase Console, click on "Authentication" in the left sidebar.
- Go to the "Sign-in method" tab.
- Enable the following sign-in providers (GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket):
  -> GitHub: Enable GitHub and enter your OAuth credentials from GitHub (you will need to register your app with GitHub).
  -> GitLab: Enable GitLab and enter your OAuth credentials from GitLab (you will need to register your app with GitLab).
  -> Bitbucket: Enable Bitbucket (note: you may need to set this up manually in Firebase if not listed, as Bitbucket isn’t natively supported).

3. Obtain OAuth Credentials:
- For each provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), you will need to set up OAuth credentials in their respective developer portals to get Client ID and Client Secret.
  -> For GitHub: GitHub OAuth App Setup (https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
  -> For GitLab: GitLab OAuth Setup (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/oauth_provider.html)
  -> For Bitbucket: Bitbucket OAuth App Setup (https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/authentication)

4. Add the OAuth Credentials:
- For each provider, after registering your app with their developer portal, copy the Client ID and Client Secret into the appropriate fields in the Firebase 
Authentication console.
