To implement this authentication system in your Git UI app, you can follow these steps:

1. Integrate OAuth Authentication:
- Use OAuth to authenticate users with their Git accounts (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). This will give your app the necessary access to verify the user's identity 
and their repositories.
- Use libraries like Firebase Authentication or Passport.js to manage OAuth flow and securely authenticate users. Firebase Authentication can simplify this process 
by handling the entire flow for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket logins.

2. Store User Authentication Info:
- Once the user logs in via OAuth, save their authentication tokens (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) in your app's state or a session. This will allow you to check if they 
are logged in and which account they are logged into.

3. Verify the Repo Link:
- When a user pastes a repo link, extract the username or organization part of the URL (e.g., in GitHub, it's in the github.com/username/repo-name format).
- Compare the username in the link with the authenticated user’s Git account. If they match, proceed to connect the repo to the user's account without requiring 
re-authentication.

4. Prompt Authentication When Needed:
- If the username in the repo link does not match the authenticated user’s account or if the user is not logged in, prompt the user to log in again with their Git 
account to verify ownership before proceeding with the connection.

5. Security Measures:
- Use secure tokens (OAuth tokens) to ensure that each API request is authorized.
- Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for extra security when users log in or connect a repo to their account.
- Ensure that repo connections are limited to the user's repositories by checking if the authenticated user has access to the requested repository.

6. Flow Implementation Example:
- Step 1: User logs in via OAuth (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
- Step 2: User pastes the repo link.
- Step 3: Extract username from the link and compare it with the authenticated username.
  -> If matched: Connect the repo directly.
  -> If not matched or user not authenticated: Prompt user for login and verify repo ownership.
