Great! Since you want to go step by step and avoid issues, I recommend starting with the backend first. Here’s why:

1. Core Functionality First – The backend will handle authentication (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket login), repository integration, and Firebase storage.

2. Stable API for the Frontend – Once the backend is functional, the frontend can be built to communicate smoothly with it.

3. Avoid Redesigning – If we build the frontend first, we might have to modify it later to fit backend constraints.

Step-by-Step Plan:

Backend Development:

1. Set Up Express.js Server – If not already done.

2. Implement Firebase Authentication – Configure user login via Git providers.

3. Repository Management – Allow users to link their Git repositories.

4. Database Setup – Store user data and Git histories in Firebase.

5. API Development – Build endpoints for the frontend to interact with.

Frontend Development (After Backend is Ready):

1. Set Up UI Framework – Use React + Tailwind CSS for styling.

2. Integrate Authentication – Connect frontend login to backend.

3. Build Dashboard – Display user repositories and commit history.

4. Implement Features – Add real-time updates and repository management.

Since we’re planning to use Firebase, let’s confirm: Do you want Firebase to store all user data and Git histories, 
or do you plan to use an external database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for some parts?
